# Try to sleep

You decide that you can't fight while you're this exhausted. Maxine volunteers to take the first watch while Halley, James and you lie down in your tents. As you close your eyes you notice how straining it was to keep them open all this time. Under normal circumstances you would've fallen asleep immediately, but now you can't find any rest. You switch your mind off and just lie there until Maxine pops her head in your tent, telling you the first 3 hours are over. 

James and Halley are up as well, and they haven't been able to sleep either. The sun is coming up, so you decide to stop attempting to sleep. But you can all feel the impact of being awake for 24 hours.

    getLevelState().includes("gathering-firewood") 
        ? <p>Even longer in your case...</p>
        : <p>Even longer in Halley's case...</p>
}

Suddenly you hear the forrest start rustling around you, louder than ever before.

{/* If you have the infrared goggles */}
{
    getLevelState().includes("follow-stench") 
        ? <p>You look through the infrared goggles you got off the body near the bunker and check the edges of the forrest. You can see several creatures with needle-like teeth lurking behind trees and in the bushes, moving around, trying to find an angle to sneak closer undetected. When you stare right at them, they freeze. They can tell you've seen them.</p>
        : <p>You look around the edges of the forrest. You could swear that you see faces behind the trees and in the bushes, but you can't be sure. You can tell that the rustling is getting closer.</p>
}

You're about to be attacked. What should you do?
