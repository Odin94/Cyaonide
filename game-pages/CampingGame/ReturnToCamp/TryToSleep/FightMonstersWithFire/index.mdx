# Fight the creatures with fire

You remember that the creatures are weak to fire. You build flamethrowers from deodorants and lighters, and you pack your pocket knives as backup weapons.

{/* If you have the infrared goggles */}

    getLevelState().includes("follow-stench") 
        ? <div>
            <p>Using the infrared goggles you spot the approaching creatures. There's at least three of them, two approaching together and one isolated, trying to flank you. </p>
            <p>You coordinate the others to focus their fire on the isolated creature. It's skin scorches much faster than human skin would, and it becomes visible to the naked eye. It lets loose a blood curdling scream and tries to slash at James, who manages to mostly avoid the attack, but still receives a deep cut in his arm. Blood is pouring from James' arm as Maxine jumps the creature with her knife, which cuts through its skin like paper. The creature goes down.</p>
            <p>The other two creatures hesitate after seeing what you did to their companion. You and Halley manage to take advantage of that and torch them before they can react, then take them out with your knives. To make sure you're safe you burn the unmoving bodies.</p>
            <p>You help James put on a bandage to stop the bleeding. He looks pale.</p>
            <p>You stay vigilant for a while until you're confident the creatures won't be back. Then you make the track back to the road where you were dropped off on Friday. The driver is already waiting for you.</p>
            <p>You don't tell him much, as you're sure he wouldn't believe you. But you ask him to take you to the closest village and drop you off there. From the village, you call the police.</p>
            <p>The police ask you plenty of questions. You show them all the evidence you've gathered at the bunker.</p>
            <p>James is taken to a hospital to receive blood transfusions. The blade that made the cut was very sharp, so the bleeding hadn't stopped yet. The EMTs assure you that he will recover.</p>
            <p>For weeks you can't sleep. But eventually, although very lightly at first, you start slumbering again until you make a full recovery.</p>
        </div>
        : <div>
            <p>You can barely see the creatures as they're nearly transparent. Only if you intently focus on their position can you spot their needle-teethed faces. Two of them are approaching you from the front. You get ready to torch them.</p>
            <p>As soon as they get in range you let fire your makeshift flamethrowers. Their skin scorches much faster than human skin would, and they become fully visible. In that moment, you hear a gurgling sound. You spin around to see Maxine's throat cut, blood spilling like from a fountain as she sinks to the ground. Another creature had sneaked up from behind. You try to torch it, but it's already retreating.</p>
            <p>At the same time James and Halley jumped the two creatures you burned with fists and knives. James manages to tackle a creature to the ground, audibly cracking its bones. It manages to sink its teeth into his arm before James' knife penetrates its skull and it stops moving. Halley manages to stab the other creature in the back as it turns to retreat. It jitters for a moment, then drops and stops moving. To make sure you're safe you burn the unmoving bodies.</p>
            <p>Now that the fight is over you and James turn your attention to Maxine as Halley keeps watch for the last creature, in case it tries to sneak up on you again. You take your jacket off, wrap it around Maxine's cut neck and put pressure on the wound. James stops you. She is already dead.</p>
            <p>You take a minute to mourn the loss of your friend and place her body in her tent. You will send to police to retrieve her later. For now, you have to get yourselves to safety.</p>
            <p>You make the track back to the road where you were dropped off on Friday. The driver is already waiting for you.</p>
            <p>You don't tell him much, as you're sure he wouldn't believe you. But you ask him to take you to the closest village and drop you off there. From the village, you call the police.</p>
            <p>The police ask you plenty of questions. You show them all the evidence you've gathered at the bunker.</p>
            <p>They find and recover Maxine's body. You attend the funeral and do your best to comfort her parents.</p>
            <p>After some time you see reports about people suffering from insomnia before being attacked and killed by ravenous animals on TV.</p>
            <p>You can't sleep. Every time you close your eyes you see their needle-like teeth. You hear the gurgling sounds Maxine made when they cut her throat.</p>
            <p>Sometimes you hear the leaves rustle outside your window and you think they've come to finish what they started.</p>
            <p>But they never come.</p>
