# Fight the creatures with knives

You all grab your pocket knives and prepare to fight.

{/* If you have the infrared goggles */}
{
    getLevelState().includes("follow-stench") 
        ? <div>
            <p>Using the infrared goggles you spot the approaching creatures. There are at least three of them, two approaching together and one isolated, trying to flank you. </p>
            <p>You coordinate the others to focus their attack on the isolated creature. James stabs at it, but he can barely see the creature and it is fast, so it manages to dodge his attack. The creature counters by slashing at James' stomach and he receives a deep cut. Maxine jumps the creature and knocks it to the ground. You can hear its brittle bones break on impact. It lets loose a blood curdling scream as she plunges her knife through its skull. Blood is pouring from James' belly as he falls to the ground, clutching the wound.</p>
            <p>The other two creatures hesitate after seeing what you did to their companion. You and Halley try to take advantage of that and take them down before they can react, but again you are hindered by being barely able to see the transparent creatures. They manage to avoid your attacks and slip out of sight.</p>
            <p>You help James put on a bandage try and stop the bleeding, but blood soakes through the gauze quickly. He looks pale.</p>
            <p>You stay vigilant for a while until you're confident the creatures won't be back. Then you make the track back to the road where you were dropped off on Friday. You have to carry James as he can't walk on his own. The driver is already waiting for you.</p>
            <p>You don't tell him much, as you're sure he wouldn't believe you. But you ask him to take you to the closest village and drop you off there. From the village, you call the police and an ambulance for James.</p>
            <p>James is taken away by the ambulance. You later receive a call telling you he didn't make it. He had lost too much blood.</p>
            <p>The police ask you plenty of questions. You show them all the evidence you've gathered at the bunker.</p>
            <p>You attend James' the funeral and do your best to comfort his parents.</p>
            <p>You can't sleep. Every time you close your eyes you see their needle-like teeth. You see James on the ground, clutching his wound.</p>
            <p>Sometimes you hear the leaves rustle outside your window and you think they've come to finish what they started.</p>
            <p>But they never come.</p>        
          </div>
        : <div>
            <p>You can barely see the creatures as they're nearly transparent. Only if you intently focus on their position can you spot their needle-teethed faces. Two of them are approaching you from the front. You get ready stab at them.</p>
            <p>As soon as they get in range you jump them with your knives. They're hard to hit since you can barely seem them and they're fast. In that moment, you hear a gurgling sound. You spin around to see Maxine's throat cut, blood spilling like from a fountain as she sinks to the ground. Another creature had sneaked up from behind. You try to tackle it, but it's already retreating.</p>
            <p>At the same time James and Halley jumped the two creatures that were in front of you with fists and knives. James manages to tackle a creature to the ground, audibly cracking its bones. It manages to sink its teeth into his arm before James' knife penetrates its skull and it stops moving. Halley misses the other creature and it slices through her belly. She falls to the ground, clutching her wound. As it bends down to cut her throat you stab it in the neck. As it falls it slashes your arm, leaving a deep cut. You stab at it again and again, long until after it stops moving.</p>
            <p>You take your jacket off and try to wrap it around Halley's wound as a bandage and you apply pressure to try to stop the bleeding. James attempts the same for Maxine, but she has gone pale and cold. There's nothing you can do for her. You and James wrap up the wounds on your arms.</p>
            <p>You take a minute to mourn the loss of your friend and place her body in her tent. You will send to police to retrieve her later. For now, you have to get yourselves to safety.</p>
            <p>You make the track back to the road where you were dropped off on Friday. You have to carry Halley as she can't walk on her own. The driver is already waiting for you.</p>
            <p>You don't tell him much, as you're sure he wouldn't believe you. But you ask him to take you to the closest village and drop you off there. From the village, you call the police and an ambulance for Halley.</p>
            <p>Halley is taken away by the ambulance. You later receive a call telling you she didn't make it. She had lost too much blood.</p>
            <p>The police ask you plenty of questions. You show them all the evidence you've gathered at the bunker.</p>
            <p>They find and recover Maxine's body. You attend the funeral and do your best to comfort her parents. You do the same at Halley's funeral.</p>
            <p>After some time you see reports about people suffering from insomnia before being attacked and killed by ravenous animals on TV.</p>
            <p>You can't sleep. Every time you close your eyes you see their needle-like teeth. You hear the gurgling sounds Maxine made when they cut her throat. You see Halley fall to the ground and clutch her wounds. The scar in your arm hurts.</p>
            <p>Sometimes you hear the leaves rustle outside your window and you think they've come to finish what they started.</p>
            <p>But they never come.</p>
