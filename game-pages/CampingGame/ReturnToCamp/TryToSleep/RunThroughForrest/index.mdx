# Run through forrest

You can't stay here any longer, you have to leave. Right. Now. You leave your tents behind, campfire still burning. You pack light, always checking the edge of the forrest for the creature. But you see nothing.

You make your way through the forrest, back to the road where you were dropped off on Friday. It's a tough hike, especially after all you've been through. After a short while, you start hearing the familiar rustling sound again. The creature must be on your trail, stalking you. You keep moving quickly and do not look back.

Eventually you make it to the road. It does not make you feel any safer. There's many miles of hiking left until you reach civilization.

            <p>Your strength leaves you again. The energy drinks could only keep you going for so long. You go down to your knees. James walks over to help you up as you hear a loud rustling from the woods behind you just on your right. You turn and see three transparent, needle-teethed creatures with long blades on their arms emerge from the forrest. Even illuminated by your flashlight they're barely visible. James tells Halley and Maxine to run as he draws a knife from his poket and rushes one of the creatures.</p> 
            <p>He manages to stab one of them, but underestimates the speed at which the others move as their blades cut into his body. He drops, lifeless.</p>
            <p>You have no strength to defend yourself left and the creatures sense it. They do not bother killing you before clawing open your stomach to feast on your intestines.</p>
            <p>After minutes of unbearable pain, everything goes dark. Your last thought is that at least Maxine and Halley will make it out alive. You die.</p>

            <p>Halleys strength leaves her again. The energy drinks could only keep her going for so long. She goes down to her knees. You and James walk over to help her up as you hear a loud rustling from the woods behind her just to the left. You see three transparent, needle-teethed creatures with long blades on their arms emerge from the forrest. Even illuminated by your flashlight they're barely visible. James tells Maxine and you to run as he draws a knife from his poket and rushes one of the creatures.</p>
            <p>He manages to stab one of them, but underestimates the speed at which the others move as their blades cut into his body. He drops, lifeless.</p>
            <p>You realize that you can't save Halley and start running. You do not turn around to look as you hear her screams.</p>
            <p>You run and run and run. At many points you think that you cannot keep going, but you press on. So does Maxine. Eventually you make it out of the forrest. A car approaches and you jump in its way to stop it. The driver takes you to a nearby village from where you call the police.</p>
            <p>The police ask Maxine and you plenty of questions. You show them all the evidence you've gathered at the bunker.</p>
            <p>They find James' and Halley's bodies, their intestines eaten. James' throat is cut, Halley was alive for most of her being eaten. You try not to think about it. They don't find the creatures.</p>
            <p>The police ask Maxine and you plenty of questions. You show them all the evidence you've gathered at the bunker.</p>
            <p>After some time you see reports about people suffering from insomnia before being attacked and killed by ravenous animals on TV.</p>
            <p>You can't sleep. Every time you close your eyes you see their needle-like teeth. You hear Halley's scream.</p>
            <p>Sometimes you hear the leaves rustle outside your window and you think they've come to finish what they started.</p>
            <p>But they never come.</p>
