# Stay at night

You decide to stay around a bit longer to investigate. You search the area for hints about what happened here, but anything you find is too burned up to use. Eventually it becomes too dark to see anything outside of the small radius of your flashlights. That's when you start hearing weird noises from the surrounding bushes and trees. Maxine is scared, but Halley tells her it's just the wind rustling some leaves. You're not so sure about that, though. The wind hasn't changed, but those sounds just now started.

You tell everyone that it would be better to head back to camp now as the flashlights won't last much longer. You're walking back in the direction of the camp, but the noises seem to follow you. Eventually Maxine let's out a cry of horror as her flashlight illuminates a transparent, humanoid figure between the trees a few meters in front of you. You see your own and two other cones of light try to trace the figure, but it vanishes as quickly as it appeared. Only three flashlights.. You look around and can't spot Halley. She's gone.

James screams at you to run and storms off in a panic. After just a second he is already out of sight. Maxine is crying and holding on to you as her weak voice tells you that you have to find Halley. Your flashlight goes out. Dead battery.

That is the moment you feel something sharp puncture your throat. Your last thought is that you should've left before it got dark. 

Everything goes black.

You die.
