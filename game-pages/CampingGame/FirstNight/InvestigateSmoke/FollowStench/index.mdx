# Follow the stench of rotten flesh

You follow the stench of rotten flesh. After some searching you find the source: The corpse of a man in camouflage uniform leaning against a tree. His throat was cut by something very sharp and it looks like an animal ripped his belly open to feast on his intestines. The putrid smell and grisly sight make Halley throw up while Maxine holds her hair. James tells you he's scared and wants to leave. From his work as a nurse he can tell this man hasn't been dead for very long based on the fly eggs in his wounds that haven't hatched into maggots yet. Who or whatever killed him might still be close.

But you want to take a closer look before leaving. You notice a strange device next to the man that looks like sci-fi night vision goggles.

It seems like they're some sort of infrared goggles. You decide to keep them, both because they might come in handy and as physical evidence of what you witnessed here in case the police doesn't believe your words.
