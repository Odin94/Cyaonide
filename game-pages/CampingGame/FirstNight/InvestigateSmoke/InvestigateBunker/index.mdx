# Investigate the Bunker

As you get closer to the bunker the smell of the smoke gets overwhelming and you have to hold a piece of cloth over your mouth to breathe. The air makes your eyes sting. It looks like the gate to the bunker has been destroyed by an explosion from the inside.

Against your better judgement, you and James take a look inside. Halley and Maxine are waiting outside and tell you to be careful. Only your flashlights illuminate the pitch black darkness. Not far in you find a massive, shut steel gate bearing the words "EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN". There's no way you're getting through that. However, there's another small door off to the side. Behind it you find a small office full of ashes, blackened walls and some remains of scorched furniture. On a mostly undamaged desk you spot a radio device. 

You take a couple of photos with your phones before you go back outside.
