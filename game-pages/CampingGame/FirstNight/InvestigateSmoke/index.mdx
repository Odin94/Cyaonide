# Investigate the smoke

You grab a light backpack and start hiking towards the smoke. There's few trails and you spend a lot of time cutting straight through the underbrush, which is slow and exhausting. You also have to be careful to avoid spiders, ticks and other small animals. 

After a few hours you start smelling the smoke combined with a garlic-like, acrid odor. A couple dozen of meters down from the hill you stand on you spot what looks like the entry to a burnt out bunker. Halley says she's unsure whether she really wants to get closer. As you pause to discuss, the wind turns and you notice another smell - almost like rotten flesh.
