# The Dreaded Camping Ground

You and your friends Halley, James and Maxine are big fans of true crime and supernatural spooky conspiracy podcasts. On the most recent episode you listened to there was mention of monster sightings and reports of secret government facilities in a forrest just a few hours of a train ride away from where you live. This is an opportunity that you could not pass up. So you all pack up and hop on a train on Friday afternoon.

You reach a desolate train station in the middle of nowhere and take a cab to the edge of the forrest. You tell the driver to pick you up at the same spot on Sunday afternoon before venturing into the woods.

It's an arduous walk through the stony trails, but eventually you make it to a fairly large clearing and decide to set up camp.
